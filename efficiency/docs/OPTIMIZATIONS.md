# R-KV on vLLM — Validation Record, Known Limitations & Roadmap

This port re-implements the R-KV runtime wiring against vLLM **v0.25.1**. The
`rkv/` algorithm is CPU bit-parity tested, the wiring patch applies cleanly to a
pristine v0.25.1 tree, and the end-to-end serving path is **validated on an
NVIDIA H100** (vLLM 0.25.1, torch 2.11+cu130, `Qwen2.5-0.5B` / `Qwen2.5-Math-7B`,
default PIECEWISE cudagraph + async scheduling; also cross-checked under
`--enforce-eager`).

## Validation record

- **Smoke** — server starts, generates coherent output, no crash.
- **Compaction fires** — `budget=64, buffer=16` over a 150-token generation
  performs hundreds of physical compactions, each keeping exactly `budget`
  entries.
- **Position consistency** — with `budget=2048` (no eviction on a 200-token
  generation) R-KV output is **byte-identical** to Full-KV across prompts,
  proving the logical/physical position + slot-mapping wiring is transparent
  when nothing is evicted.
- **Quality scales with budget** — see the GSM8K sweep below.
- **Batch > 1** — validated up to 64 concurrent requests; each compresses
  independently.
- **Tensor & data parallelism** — under tensor parallelism (TP) each rank holds
  only a shard of the KV heads, so `compact_step` all-reduces the per-token
  scores across the TP group before the top-k; every rank then evicts the
  identical set and the sharded KV stays consistent. Validated: TP=2 few-shot
  GSM8K `b256/buf64` = **90/100 vs TP=1's 91/100** (the all-reduce reconstructs
  TP=1's global cross-head score; the ±1 is float summation-order noise near the
  top-k cutoff), plus coherent 700-token forced generations. Data parallelism (DP) needs no coordination — each replica owns
  an independent KV cache + compactor — and DP+TP is correct because the
  reduction targets the per-replica TP **sub-group** (`get_tp_group()`), not the
  world; validated on a DP=2×TP=2 server with 8 concurrent forced-long
  generations, all coherent. The collective is skipped entirely when TP is off,
  so single-GPU decode is unchanged.
- **Out-of-the-box** — setting `BUDGET`/`BUFFER` auto-selects the V1 runner and
  the PIECEWISE cudagraph path; no extra flags required (do **not** pass
  `--enforce-eager` — it disables the decode cudagraph and is ~30–40% slower).

### Accuracy — GSM8K, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct (200 questions, greedy)

| Config | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Full-KV | 94.5% (189/200) |
| R-KV budget=512 buffer=64 | 92.5% (185/200) |
| R-KV budget=384 buffer=128 | 90.5% (181/200) |
| R-KV budget=256 buffer=256 | **90.0%** (180/200) |
| R-KV budget=256 buffer=128 | 82.5% (165/200) |
| R-KV budget=256 buffer=64 | 72.5% (145/200) |

**R-KV on vLLM reaches SGLang-parity accuracy** — near-lossless at `budget=512`,
and ~90% at `budget=256` **when the buffer is large enough**. The `buffer` (how
many tokens accumulate before each compaction) is the key quality knob at tight
budgets: too small a buffer compacts too aggressively and too often. Larger
buffers are also **faster** (fewer compactions). Recommended: `buffer ≈ budget`.

### Differential test (difference check) vs SGLang — same harness, model, config

Using SGLang's own few-shot GSM8K harness (`data/gsm8k_fewshot.jsonl`, prompt
≈ 700 tokens > budget), Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, 200 questions, greedy,
`window=8`, run identically against both engines (vLLM offline `--enforce-eager`
vs the SGLang server; **decode-only** R-KV on both — `enable_rkv_prefill=False`):

| Engine / config | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| vLLM Full-KV (ceiling) | 90.5% (181/200) |
| SGLang R-KV — budget=256 buffer=64 | 88.5% (177/200) |
| **vLLM R-KV — budget=256 buffer=64** | **87.5% (175/200)** |
| vLLM R-KV — budget=256 buffer=128 | 90.5% (181/200) |

**vLLM R-KV now matches SGLang at every budget/buffer** (buffer=64: 87.5% vs
88.5% — a 1-question difference, within n=200 noise; buffer=128: 90.5% =
Full-KV, lossless). Both engines degrade only ~2–3 points from their identical
90.5% Full-KV ceiling.

Two fixes closed the original 68.5% → 87.5% gap at `budget=256 buffer=64`:

**1. Two-phase cross-layer compaction (68.5% → 82.0%).** The port previously
evicted **per-layer / per-head inside each layer's `forward`**; it now
accumulates a cross-head-**mean** score, **sums it across all layers**, makes one
global kept-set decision, and evicts every layer identically **after the full
forward** (`RKVCompressor.observe_layer` + `compact_step`).

**2. Async-scheduling cache corruption (82.0% → 87.5%).** R-KV compaction runs
inside the forward and reports each request's evicted-token count as a model
output (`num_dropped_tokens`) that the scheduler must apply **before** the next
step's *physical* KV positions are computed. vLLM V1's **async scheduling**
prepares step N+1 before step N's output is processed, so for one step after a
compaction the dropped-token count is stale and the next decode token overwrites
a surviving KV slot. The corruption is **batch-dependent** — it only appears
under the memory pressure of many concurrent requests (a prompt correct in
isolation and at N≤40 would run to the token cap producing garbage at N=100),
and it compounds with the number of compactions, so it hit long generations and
tight buffers hardest (explaining the earlier apparent "buffer sensitivity").
Fixed: **R-KV force-disables async scheduling** in `VllmConfig.__post_init__`
(alongside prefix caching), so the eviction accounting is always current. This
alone lifted `buffer=64` from 82.0% → **87.5%** and restored `buffer=128` to the
lossless **90.5%**.

**Prefix-caching bug (earlier):** with **prefix caching ON**, the shared
exemplar prefix's KV blocks are shared across requests; R-KV's in-place eviction
of one request corrupts the shared blocks of the others (output bleeds another
request's content). Fixed: **R-KV force-disables prefix caching** in
`VllmConfig.__post_init__` (mirrors SGLang's required `--disable-radix-cache`).

With these fixes the port is byte-consistent per-prompt regardless of batch
composition, and matches SGLang to within noise. The final ~1-point spread at
`buffer=64` is attention-backend numerics (vLLM FlashAttention vs SGLang
FlashInfer produce slightly different K/Q feeding the scorer) amplified by
R-KV's discrete top-k selection near the score cutoff — vLLM's post-RoPE keys
match the HuggingFace reference bit-closely. Use `buffer ≈ budget` for best
accuracy.



### Measured throughput (H100, Qwen2.5-0.5B, equal work, `ignore_eos`)

This is a **non-memory-bound** microbenchmark (0.5B on an 80GB H100 → huge KV
pool), so it measures R-KV's **overhead**, not its benefit. R-KV's advantage
(constant per-request KV footprint → more concurrency / longer context) only
shows up when memory-bound.

| Config | N×tok | tok/s |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-KV (V2 runner + CUDA graph, production default) | 64×512 | ~27,800 |
| Full-KV (eager, fair baseline) | 64×512 | ~6,740 |
| R-KV budget=512 buffer=64 (eager) | 32×1024 | ~2,460 (−32% vs fair eager) |
| R-KV budget=256 buffer=64 (eager) | 32×1024 | ~2,170 (−40% vs fair eager) |

Two separate costs stack here: (a) **forcing eager** (no CUDA graph) is the
largest factor (~4× on this tiny model), and (b) **compaction overhead**
(O(seq²) scoring) adds ~32–40% on top. Both match the SGLang port's findings for
short, non-memory-bound decode. Raising `buffer` (compact less often) and
larger models shrink the relative overhead.

### Batched cross-layer scoring (ported from SGLang)

The compaction score is O(seq²) per layer (the redundancy cosine matrix) and
dominates R-KV's overhead. The default `score_mode="batched"` (env
`VLLM_V1_R_KV_SCORE_MODE`) defers scoring out of the per-layer `forward` and runs
it as a **single GEMM over all layers** at compaction time (`num_layers` as the
batch dim, chunked so the transient cosine matrix stays under
`VLLM_V1_R_KV_SCORE_CHUNK_MB`), instead of 28 separate bsz=1 scoring calls. The
batch GEMM computes independent per-layer results, so the kept set is **identical**
to the per-layer `score_mode="reference"` path — verified: both score 87.5%
(175/200) at `budget=256 buffer=64`, with the **same 508 compactions** — while
cutting kernel launches.

Measured (b256/buf64, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, 200q, H100): **1987 vs 1622 decode tok/s
(+22.5%)**, wall 24.4s → 19.9s, matching the SGLang port's ~+23% batched-compaction
win. The restructure stays entirely inside `rkv/integration.py` (the per-layer
window queries ride along in the already-shared `rkv_layer_caches` list), so the
wiring patch is untouched.

### Throughput profile — where the time goes (next optimization)

Measured decomposition under PIECEWISE cudagraph (b256, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, 200q,
H100 decode tok/s):

| config | tok/s | isolates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-KV FULL cudagraph | 8317 | ceiling |
| Full-KV PIECEWISE (attention eager) | 8054 | **graphing attention = +3% only** |
| R-KV buf512 (rare compaction) | 2784 | **R-KV per-step hooks = −65%** |
| ↳ `record_query` skipped | **4267** | **`record_query` alone = +53%** |
| R-KV buf16 (frequent compaction) | 2103 | compaction cost = −24% |

> `record_query` skipped = the +53% ceiling that motivated **P4a below**, now
> largely recovered by the ring-buffer rewrite (buf64 PIECEWISE 2623 → **3880**).

Two conclusions redirect the roadmap:

1. **`record_query` is the dominant cost, not compaction scoring.** It runs
   28×/step (once per attention layer) with a **per-request Python loop that does
   a tiny GPU `copy_` per request** — thousands of micro-kernel-launches per step
   for a large batch. Skipping it recovers +53% at `buffer=512`.
2. **Graphing attention buys only ~3%** here, so a full SGLang-style hybrid that
   FULL-captures attention (roadmap P4b) is *low* value on this workload.

**Implemented (roadmap P4a): vectorized `record_query`.** Mirrors the SGLang
port — the per-request dict + per-request GPU copies are replaced with a single
**`index_copy_` scatter** into a **fixed-address** ring buffer
`(window, max_slots, q_heads, head_dim)` (one ring per layer), indexed by a
persistent per-request column (`_slot`, freed + reused on finish) and a
per-request step counter (cursor = `count % window`). One scatter per layer
per step replaces the thousands of micro-launches; the score means over the
window so the ring needs no un-rotation. The ring grows (realloc + copy) only on
a new concurrency peak, so it is amortized after the first prefill wave.

Measured (b256, 200q, H100 decode tok/s; accuracy **unchanged** — eager buf64 =
89.0% = 178/200, exactly matching pre-change):

| config | before | after | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| buf64 eager | 2122 | **3030** | **+43%** |
| buf64 PIECEWISE | 2623 | **3880** | **+48%** |
| buf16 PIECEWISE | 2103 | 2807 | +33% |
| buf128 PIECEWISE | 2705 | 3747 | +39% |
| buf256 PIECEWISE | 2686 | 3611 | +34% |

Note: SGLang's query recording is *not* a Triton kernel — it is exactly this
vectorized `index_copy_` (`_rolling_q_flat[layer].index_copy_(0, index, q)`); its
fused **Triton kernel is for the redundancy cosine-similarity in the *scoring***
(`cal_similarity`), a different hot path already handled here by batched scoring.

**Remaining P4a headroom — done (P4a′, centralized).** The per-layer version
still repeated the Python slot loop + the small H2D of the flat index **28×/step**
(once per layer, identical each time). This is now computed **once per step** in
the runner: `RKVCompressor.plan_qwrite(req_ids, device)` runs on the runner's
compactor and returns `(flat_index, slots, max_slots)`, shared with every
attention layer through a new `attn_metadata.rkv_qplan` field. Each layer only
grows its ring and scatters its own queries with the precomputed index. This
lifts b256/buf64 PIECEWISE from 3880 → **4233 tok/s = ~99% of the
`record_query`-skipped ceiling (4267)** — `record_query` is now effectively free.
Accuracy is unchanged (eager buf64 = 89.0% = 178/200, exact match). Because the
plan is a single shared index, recording is now graph-capturable, so a future
FULL-cudagraph pass (P4b) no longer has a per-layer Python obstacle here.

A cheap complementary win that remains is to **gate recording to the observation
window** — only the last `window` (8) steps before each compaction need queries,
so record `window / buffer` of steps (8× fewer at buf64, 64× at buf512).

### What's left after `record_query` — R-KV's per-step decode overhead is ~0

Once `record_query` is free (P4a′), a controlled A/B (single-process, N=128, H100)
shows R-KV has **no measurable per-step decode overhead** left. The apparent
"R-KV is 2× slower than Full-KV" is entirely **two features R-KV disables for
correctness** — prefix caching and async scheduling — plus a benchmark artifact
(shared-prefix few-shot prompts). Decode tok/s = output tokens ÷ total wall, so
the one-time prefill is folded in; prefix caching slashes the *prefill* of these
shared-prefix prompts.

| config (async off unless noted) | tok/s | isolates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-KV, async **on**, FULL, prefix on | 7613 | absolute ceiling |
| Full-KV, FULL, prefix on | 5846 | **async scheduling = −23%** |
| Full-KV, PIECEWISE, prefix on | 5826 | **attention-graph = ~0%** |
| Full-KV, PIECEWISE, **prefix off** | 3756 | **prefix caching = −36%** |
| **R-KV buf512** (PIECEWISE, prefix off) | 3729 | **= Full-KV no-prefix (0 R-KV overhead)** |
| R-KV buf64 | 3758 | = baseline (0 overhead) |
| ↳ record + observe + physical-prep all no-op'd | 3854 | R-KV hooks ≈ noise |
| R-KV buf16 | 2733 | compaction every 16 steps (niche) |

Three conclusions:

1. **R-KV decode is already at parity with Full-KV.** With prefix caching off on
   both sides (the fair comparison), Full-KV = 3744–3756 and R-KV buf≥64 =
   3729–3758 — identical. No-op'ing every R-KV hook (`record_query`,
   `observe_layer`, `_rkv_prepare_physical`) leaves it at 3854, so the per-step
   CPU is noise. **There is no per-step overhead to optimize.**
2. **Prefix caching (−36% here) is the biggest lever, and R-KV cannot use it.**
   R-KV evicts *prompt* KV (budget < prompt length), and its in-place compaction
   overwrites the shared prefix blocks → cross-request corruption (bug #6). So
   `VllmConfig.__post_init__` force-disables prefix caching. This is **fundamental
   to R-KV, not a vLLM defect** — SGLang R-KV likewise requires
   `--disable-radix-cache`. The −36% is also **inflated by this benchmark**: the
   few-shot prompts share a long exemplar prefix, so prefix caching dedups almost
   all the prefill. With diverse production prompts (no shared prefix) prefix
   caching helps Full-KV little, and R-KV is at parity.
3. **Async scheduling (−23%) is the next lever, also a correctness disable**
   (bug #10). The earlier "attention-graph = +3%" was measured with async **on**,
   which overlaps/hides the eager-attention cost; with async off, FULL vs
   PIECEWISE is still only ~3%, so the cudagraph mode is not the issue either.

So the only ways to make R-KV approach the prefix-cached Full-KV number are the
two **correctness-sensitive** features it disables — prefix-caching compatibility
(P9) and async scheduling (P8) — each a deliberate, gated, re-validated change
(both re-enable a path that previously corrupted the KV cache), not a per-step
tuning win.

**Roadmap P9 (prefix-caching compat):** allow prefix caching but make R-KV's
compaction copy-on-write safe — before a compacting request overwrites a shared
prefix block, un-share (privatize) its blocks so the raw slot writes cannot bleed
into other requests. Recovers the shared-prefill dedup while keeping eviction
correct; needs block-manager integration.

**Roadmap P8 (async compat):** make the runner authoritative on
`num_dropped_tokens` (apply the drop right after `compact_step` instead of the
async-delayed scheduler round-trip). The scheduler's only use of the count is to
feed it back, so a runner-local update removes the bug #10 race; land it gated
(env opt-in, default = today's safe synchronous behavior) and re-validate accuracy
in the many-request memory-pressure regime.

### Decode CUDA graph (PIECEWISE) — implemented

R-KV runs under vLLM's PIECEWISE cudagraph by default (auto-selected in
`VllmConfig.__post_init__`; no `--enforce-eager`). Attention stays eager so the
R-KV hooks fire; the rest of the decode layer is graphed. Same accuracy as eager
(within n=200 noise) at **+30–40% decode throughput** on R-KV configs and **+62%**
on Full-KV. See Known limitations #2.

### Bugs found & fixed during GPU validation

1. `RKVCompressor` constructed `R1KV` even when disabled → assertion crash at
   startup. Fixed: the algorithm is only built when R-KV is enabled.
2. `compact_batch` used `key_cache.view(...)`, which fails on the
   non-contiguous post-`unbind` paged cache. Fixed: `(block, offset)` advanced
   indexing (gather on read, scatter in place on write).
3. R-KV silently no-op'd on v0.25.1's default V2 model runner. Fixed: R-KV
   auto-selects the V1 runner when enabled (`VllmConfig.use_v2_model_runner`).
4. `occupied_slot_mapping` indexed the fixed-size `arange_np`, overflowing when
   total batch KV exceeded one step's token budget (batch>1, long context).
   Fixed: build the per-request position ramp with `np.arange(total_kv)`.
5. Compaction fired during **chunked prefill** of long prompts (partial-prefill
   eviction → `num_dropped > num_computed` → crash). Fixed: gate compaction to
   the decode phase (`num_computed_tokens > num_prompt_tokens`).
6. **Prefix caching corrupted R-KV** (shared prefix blocks mutated in place →
   cross-request KV bleed → ~1.5% accuracy on shared-prefix workloads). Found
   via the SGLang difference check. Fixed: force-disable prefix caching when R-KV is on.
7. **Per-layer / per-head eviction diverged from the R-KV reference** — each
   layer independently ran top-k *inside its own forward*, compounding scoring
   noise across all layers. Fixed: **two-phase cross-layer compaction** —
   cross-head **mean**, **summed across all layers**, one global kept set
   evicted after the full forward (`observe_layer` + `compact_step`).
8. **First compaction fired far too early.** The scheduler armed on absolute
   `num_computed_tokens % buffer`; for a prompt length not a multiple of
   `buffer` this fired a few decode steps in and evicted most of the prompt off
   a nearly-cold observation window (permanent damage). Fixed: arm on the
   **decode-relative** count (`num_computed_tokens - num_prompt_tokens`), so the
   first compaction lands `buffer` steps into decode with a warm window
   (matches SGLang's cadence).
9. **Observation window was empty on mixed batches.** `record_query` skipped any
   step whose query rows ≠ request count — i.e. every mixed prefill/decode step
   under continuous batching — so the window was under-populated. Fixed: gather
   each request's *last* query token via `query_start_loc` (vectorized, no host
   sync).
10. **Async scheduling corrupted the post-compaction KV (batch-dependent).**
    Compaction reports its evicted-token count as a model output
    (`num_dropped_tokens`) that the scheduler must apply before the next step's
    *physical* KV positions are computed; vLLM V1 async scheduling prepares step
    N+1 before step N's output is processed, so the count was stale for one step
    after every compaction and the next decode token overwrote a surviving KV
    slot. Only surfaced under many concurrent requests (a prompt correct in
    isolation ran to the token cap producing garbage in a 100-request batch) and
    compounded with the number of compactions, so it hit long generations /
    tight buffers hardest. Fixed: **force-disable async scheduling when R-KV is
    on** (`VllmConfig.__post_init__`). Lifted `budget=256 buffer=64` from
    82.0% → **87.5%** (SGLang: 88.5%) and restored `buffer=128` to lossless
    90.5%.
11. **Preemption left the dropped-token counter stale.** `_preempt_request`
    resets `num_computed_tokens = 0` (a preempted request recomputes from
    scratch) but left `num_dropped_tokens` untouched, so on resume the physical
    position (`logical − dropped`) would go **negative** and corrupt the paged
    KV. Fixed: reset `num_dropped_tokens = 0` alongside `num_computed_tokens`.
    Defensive — preemption does not fire on the GSM8K sweep (no accuracy change),
    but the reset is required for correctness under high-concurrency / memory
    pressure. Found while investigating the `buffer=16` gap (see below).
12. **`mix_lambda` default mismatched the reference (the tight-buffer gap).** The
    joint score is `mix_lambda·importance − (1−mix_lambda)·redundancy`. vLLM
    defaulted to **0.07** (the R-KV *algorithm class* default), but SGLang's
    runtime `RKVConfig` and the reference HF eval scripts use **0.1**. The
    importance/redundancy imbalance shifts the kept set, and the error
    **compounds with compaction frequency** — so it hit `buffer=16` (≈12
    compactions/request) far harder than `buffer=64` (≈3). This was the main
    driver of the vLLM-vs-SGLang *buffer sensitivity*. Fixed: default
    `mix_lambda = 0.1` (matches SGLang). Effect at `budget=256`: buf16
    83.0→**85.5**, buf64 87.5→**89.0** (now ≥ SGLang's 88.5), buf128
    90.5→**91.5** (> SGLang's 89.0). (My earlier "0.07 is better" reading was
    confounded by the pre-fix async corruption, bug #10.)
13. **Evicted KV blocks were never freed (no memory saving; the whole point of
    R-KV).** Compaction only *flagged* evicted tokens via `num_dropped_tokens`
    (used to compute physical positions); the scheduler's block manager never
    referenced it, so it kept allocating a block per *logical* token. The KV
    footprint grew unbounded with the sequence — R-KV shrank only the *attention*
    length, not memory, and long generations could OOM. Fixed
    (`KVCacheManager.allocate_slots` + coordinator/single-type managers): once a
    request has compacted (`num_dropped_tokens > 0`) its physical KV is bounded
    at `budget + buffer` tokens (survivors relocate to the low slots; new tokens
    reuse the high slots each cycle), so cap the block reservation at
    `ceil((budget+buffer)/block_size)+1` and free the high blocks holding only
    evicted KV (reusing the sliding-window `_remove_blocks_in_range` null-fill).
    The worker never indexes past the cap, so no block-table change is needed.
    Gated by `VLLM_V1_R_KV_FREE_BLOCKS`, now **opt-in (default off)**: the block
    manager frees blocks *below* the runner's reservation cap without a two-way
    version handshake between the scheduler's block table and the worker's
    physical slot mapping, so it is kept off by default and enabled explicitly
    for the memory/throughput win (a full block-table version protocol is
    roadmap). Validated: accuracy **bit-identical** whether on or off
    (b256/buf64 = 89.0%; re-confirmed round 5 at 91/100 on the few-shot harness,
    FREE=0 and FREE=1 identical); a 1500-token gen holds **21 blocks vs 95**;
    under tight KV, 200×1024-token requests run at **8215 vs 4656 tok/s
    (+76%)** because the bounded footprint lets far more run concurrently.

## Tight-buffer (`buffer=16`) gap — root-caused to `mix_lambda`, residual numerics

At `budget=256 buffer=16` vLLM originally scored **83.0%** vs SGLang's **88.0%**,
and unlike SGLang was *buffer-sensitive* (buf64 87.5% → buf16 83.0%, vs SGLang's
flat 88.5% → 88.0%). A full step-by-step differential (as for bug #10) traced
most of that asymmetry to the **`mix_lambda` config mismatch** (bug #12):

- Cadence, single-prompt correctness, physical positions, preemption, slot
  collisions and the algorithm were all verified **identical/correct**; two
  identical batch runs are byte-for-byte deterministic (not a race).
- The remaining lever was the R-KV **algorithm parameters**. Comparing them
  against SGLang's runtime config exposed `mix_lambda` (0.07 vs 0.1). A clean
  sweep confirmed it: at `mix_lambda=0.1`, buf64 matches SGLang and buf16 gains
  +2.5.

After the fix, `budget=256` `buffer≥64` **meets or beats SGLang**; only `buf16`
still trails by ~2.5 pts (85.5% vs 88.0%). That residual is a genuine
borderline-top-k sensitivity to the FlashAttention-vs-FlashInfer K/Q numerics,
amplified ~4× by buf16's compaction frequency (a `mix_lambda` of 0.12 reaches
89% at buf16 but that overfits and lowers buf64 — so 0.1, the SGLang/HF value, is
the principled default). **Use `buffer ≥ 64`** (`buffer=128` is lossless).

## Known limitations

1. **V1 GPU model runner only.** v0.25.1 ships a newer V2 runner
   (`vllm/v1/worker/gpu/`) as the default for many models; R-KV is wired into
   the V1 runner and auto-selects it whenever enabled. **Roadmap P0** — port the
   wiring to V2.

2. **Decode CUDA graphs: PIECEWISE, auto-selected (no `--enforce-eager` needed).**
   R-KV runs its scoring/eviction hooks *inside* the attention forward (eager)
   plus a post-forward compaction. vLLM's default FULL / FULL_AND_PIECEWISE
   cudagraph **captures** the decode attention, so those Python hooks run only
   at capture → R-KV silently no-ops (runs as Full-KV). vLLM's **PIECEWISE**
   cudagraph keeps attention eager (a graph *splitting* op), so the hooks fire
   every decode step while the rest of the layer is graphed. R-KV therefore
   **force-selects PIECEWISE** in `VllmConfig.__post_init__` when enabled and
   cudagraphs are on (a no-op under `--enforce-eager`). Measured: **same accuracy
   as eager** (within n=200 noise) at **+30–40% decode throughput** (Full-KV:
   +62%). A full SGLang-style hybrid that *also* graphs attention on
   non-compaction steps (in-graph fixed-address query buffer + eager dispatch on
   compaction steps) would recover the remaining attention-eager cost —
   **Roadmap P4b**.

3. **Tight-buffer accuracy dip.** At `budget=256`, `buffer=64` = 89.0% and
   `buffer=128` = 91.5% (≥ SGLang); only `buffer=16` (85.5%) trails SGLang
   (88.0%) by ~2.5 pts — residual FlashAttention-vs-FlashInfer K/Q numerics near
   the top-k cutoff, amplified by buf16's ~12 compactions/request (bug #12 fixed
   the larger part via `mix_lambda`). Recommended: `buffer ≥ 64`.

4. **FlashAttention backend only — enforced.** R-KV's scoring/eviction hooks run
   inside the FlashAttention forward; other backends (FlashInfer, Triton, MLA)
   never call them. R-KV now **refuses to start** (raises `ValueError` in
   `GPUModelRunner._rkv_validate_kv_cache`) on a non-FlashAttention cache group
   instead of silently running Full-KV. **Roadmap P3** — support more backends.

5. **`optimistic_seq_lens_cpu` stays logical.** It is used only as an upper
   bound (`max_seq_len`), so an over-estimate is safe, but a few code paths that
   read the CPU seq-len copy should be audited on GPU.

6. **Fail-closed support scope.** R-KV is validated only for a single
   FullAttention paged KV cache on FlashAttention, so it **raises `ValueError`
   at startup** on combinations it cannot safely support — rather than
   corrupting KV or silently running Full-KV:

   - speculative / multi-token decode (KV is evicted right after the forward,
     before draft tokens are verified, and cannot be rolled back);
   - pipeline parallelism (`PP>1`) and decode context parallelism (`DCP>1`,
     whose logical local seq-lengths are not reconciled with R-KV's physical
     ones);
   - quantized / FP8 KV cache (scoring runs in the KV storage dtype);
   - more than one KV cache group, or a group whose spec is not **exactly**
     `FullAttentionSpec` (hybrid / Mamba / sliding-window models, and
     `FullAttentionSpec` *subclasses* such as MLA / attention-sink specs, which
     carry extra geometry R-KV does not relocate);
   - a `FullAttentionSpec` that is not plain causal full attention over a
     contiguous value cache — **sliding-window**, **chunked attention**
     (`attention_chunk_size`), **non-causal** masks, or a **`head_size_v`
     mismatch** — since those derive masking/bias/geometry from the physical KV
     index that compaction rewrites;
   - **ALiBi** attention (`alibi_slopes`): the per-token linear bias is a
     function of the *physical* KV position, which R-KV renumbers on eviction;
   - **cascade attention**: R-KV's per-layer hooks are wired only into the
     non-cascade FlashAttention path, so a cascade step would silently run
     Full-KV — it now raises instead;
   - **multimodal prefix-LM** models (`model_config.is_mm_prefix_lm`): the
     attention builder derives a bidirectional prefix mask from the *logical*
     KV positions, which no longer match the cache after R-KV renumbers KV to
     physical positions;
   - cross-layer KV cache **sharing** (two layers aliasing one storage would be
     relocated twice and corrupt the kept set);
   - dual-batch overlap / microbatching (`enable_dbo` / `ubatch_size > 1`):
     `split_attn_metadata` drops R-KV's metadata fields, so compaction would be
     silently skipped for a microbatched request;
   - KV connectors / disaggregated prefill (`kv_transfer_config`): the connector
     transfers the original logical KV layout with no notion of dropped tokens;
   - **reference scoring** on the serving path (`SCORE_MODE=reference`): the
     runner accepts only `batched` scoring, because the reference scorer
     materializes its `O(seq_len²)` matrix *inside* the forward, before
     `compact_step`'s pre-forward memory admission — so a long sequence could
     OOM before the guard runs. (Reference mode stays available to the CPU
     parity tests, which drive the compactor directly, not the runner.)
   - any non-FlashAttention cache layer.

   `RKVConfig` also validates its own knobs (`budget > window`, `buffer ≥
   window`, positive odd `kernel_size`, positive `SCORE_CHUNK_MB`, budget &
   buffer both-zero-or-both-positive, parameter ranges) and raises on bad
   values; `retain_direction` accepts only `last`/`first` (the `*_percent`
   variants are rejected — their reference indexing collapses the wrong tensor
   dimension); malformed env vars raise (naming the variable) instead of
   silently reverting to a default. **Supported:** tensor
   & data parallelism, PIECEWISE cudagraph, batched scoring, opt-in async
   scheduling (`VLLM_V1_R_KV_ASYNC`); prefix caching is auto-disabled.
   Speculative decoding, PP/DCP and hybrid models stay **roadmap** items
   (compaction after acceptance; a cross-PP score reduction; per-group slot
   mappings).

7. **Compaction is fail-closed and all-or-nothing (host side).** Once a request
   reaches the threshold its compaction *must* complete this step — a request
   that has already dropped KV cannot fall back to Full-KV (its old KV is gone
   and the block manager has capped its allocation). The runner enters
   `compact_step` whenever compaction was **armed** this step (not merely when
   some layer registered), so a step that requires compaction but registers zero
   layers still hits the checks instead of being silently skipped. Missing
   state, an incompletely registered layer set, or an incomplete observation
   window on an already-dropped request therefore **raise** rather than silently
   skip. (This is a host-side control-flow guarantee, not a CUDA transaction:
   the relocation gather→scatter and the metadata/count publication are enqueued
   in program order on the **same stream**, so they execute in order, but no
   event/`synchronize` waits for kernel completion — a *deferred* async CUDA
   error surfaces on the next sync, by which point the worker is already
   unrecoverable, so there is nothing to roll back.) Two last-line invariants back
   this up: the occupied slot mapping is checked for the reserved **null block**
   (id 0) before any KV is read/written, and the per-token scores are checked
   **finite** before the top-k (fp16 similarity underflow — the fp16 key norm is
   now accumulated in fp32 so a zero norm cannot NaN the cosine). The query-ring
   lifecycle is driven **explicitly** by the runner (free on `finished_req_ids`,
   reset **and release the ring slot** on `preempted_req_ids`) rather than
   inferred from per-step batch membership — a merely-unscheduled request keeps
   its window, while a preempted one hands its fixed-address slot back to the
   free list so a long preemption cannot leak ring slots. A **preempted**
   request does not arm compaction while it recomputes (`is_prefill_chunk`
   suppresses arming on every chunk that is still (re)processing materialised
   tokens), and its single catch-up step is left Full-KV by the incomplete-window
   check (safe: it has not dropped anything). The observation window advances
   **only on a genuine new-token decode step**, detected by *phase*
   (`rkv.integration.is_genuine_decode`): the step **reaches the frontier**
   (`num_computed + num_scheduled >= num_tokens`) while **past the prompt**
   (`num_computed >= num_prompt`). Note `num_computed` **lags `num_tokens` by one
   during decode** (the last-sampled token is counted in `num_tokens` but its KV
   is computed this step), so the naive `num_computed >= num_tokens` is never
   true during decode — using it silently disables all compaction, which
   accuracy-alone cannot detect (real R-KV ≈ 0.88 vs Full-KV ≈ 0.90); confirm via
   the `[RKV-COMPACT]` TRACE count. A non-decode step still writes its chunk-tail
   query into the current ring cell but does not advance the cursor/count, so a
   compaction right after a resume is scored against real decode queries, never
   the recompute tail. Under tensor parallelism a readiness handshake compares the
   **minimum and maximum** of a collision-resistant ordered-plan fingerprint
   across the TP group (not a sum, which an average collision could mask); the
   fingerprint folds each row's **request-id digest** (a stable cross-process
   hash, not Python's salted `hash`) alongside its batch index and seq-len, so
   ranks whose rows line up by length but hold different requests also fail
   closed. Divergent ranks fail together instead of deadlocking, and the score
   all-reduce fails closed if the TP group is missing/mismatched.

8. **Long-sequence scoring is memory-guarded, not yet tiled.** The redundancy
   matrix is `~kv_heads × seq_len²`; scoring tiles over **both** the layer and
   request dimensions to keep each batch under `VLLM_V1_R_KV_SCORE_CHUNK_MB`
   (default 512 MB), with a **2× safety margin** over the analytic estimate for
   the index/workspace/intermediate overhead the formula omits. A single
   request whose *first* compaction still exceeds the cap (a very long prompt)
   is left Full-KV (`num_dropped` stays 0, so it is never capped — safe) rather
   than risking an OOM; an already-compacted request that no longer fits raises.
   The admission check runs in `compact_step` (default `batched` mode), so the
   `reference` scoring mode — which scores inside each layer's forward — is not
   memory-admitted and is a debugging/opt-in path only. This trades R-KV's
   benefit on very long prompts for safety until sequence-dimension **tiling**
   (blockwise reduction without materializing the full `seq_len²` matrix)
   lands. **Roadmap.**

| **P10** | **Tensor & data parallelism** (all-reduce R-KV scores across the TP group; DP replicas stay independent) | **done** | correct multi-GPU: TP=2 bit-matches TP=1 accuracy (88/100); DP=2×TP=2 coherent |
