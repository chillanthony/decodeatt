"""R-KV integration layer for vLLM v1 (FlashAttention backend).

This module bridges the pure :class:`~rkv.algo.R1KV` algorithm to vLLM's paged
KV cache. It encapsulates the per-request scoring and **physical** KV eviction
that would otherwise live inline in the attention backend's ``forward`` — so the
runtime wiring patch stays small and additive.

Design (mirrors the SGLang R-KV port):

* The algorithm is **per-head / per-layer**, but a single global eviction
  decision is applied across all of them (the R-KV reference reduces the
  per-head / per-layer scores to one kept set). Compaction is therefore
  **two-phase**:

  - :meth:`RKVCompressor.observe_layer` runs inside every attention layer's
    ``forward`` (after attention has read the full KV). It computes that
    layer's per-past-token score, reduces it across KV heads (**mean**), and
    accumulates it into a shared per-request buffer (**sum** across layers).
  - :meth:`RKVCompressor.compact_step` runs once after the full forward pass
    (from the model runner). It turns the summed score into one kept set and
    physically evicts that same set from **every** layer's paged KV, reporting
    how many tokens were dropped so the scheduler / model-runner can shrink the
    logical->physical position mapping consistently.

* **Tensor parallelism**: each rank holds only a shard of the KV heads, so its
  per-token score is partial. All ranks share one physical KV layout, so the
  eviction decision must be identical on every rank -- :meth:`compact_step`
  therefore sums the per-token scores across the tensor-parallel group before
  the top-k. The armed requests, cache lengths and grouping are already
  identical on every rank (replicated scheduler state), and the collective is
  skipped entirely when TP is off. **Data parallelism** needs no coordination:
  each replica owns an independent KV cache and compactor and evicts its own
  requests (the all-reduce above uses the TP sub-group, so DP+TP is correct).

* Config is read from environment variables (see :meth:`RKVConfig.from_env`) so
  the wiring patch does not have to touch vLLM's argument parser.

Expected ``attn_metadata`` fields (added by the wiring patch):

* ``num_reqs``: int
* ``seq_lens``: ``(num_reqs,)`` physical KV length per request
* ``query_start_loc``: ``(num_reqs + 1,)`` cumulative query offsets
* ``occupied_slot_mapping``: ``(total_num_kv_cache_tokens,)`` physical slot ids
  of every currently-occupied KV entry, laid out per request
* ``should_compress_list``: ``tuple[bool, ...]`` per-request compression gate
* ``num_dropped_tokens_list``: ``list[int]`` written back in place
* ``rkv_score_acc``: ``list`` per-request cross-layer score accumulator
* ``rkv_layer_caches``: ``list`` of ``(key_cache, value_cache, window_queries)``
  registered per layer during the forward, scored/evicted together after it

    """Per-request mask: does this step generate a genuinely new decode token?

    The R-KV observation window must advance only on real decode steps, not on
    chunked prefill or a preempted request's recompute. The subtlety is that
    ``num_computed`` **lags ``num_tokens`` by one on a normal decode step**: the
    token sampled last step is already counted in ``num_tokens`` but its KV is
    computed *this* step. So a genuine decode is NOT ``num_computed >=
    num_tokens`` (that is never true during decode); it is:

    * this step reaches the sequence frontier -- ``num_computed + num_scheduled
      >= num_tokens`` -- so it is not a mid-prefill / mid-recompute chunk, AND
    * the request is already past its prompt -- ``num_computed >= num_prompt`` --
      so the last prompt chunk (which also reaches the frontier) is excluded, AND
    * the step actually has tokens -- ``num_scheduled > 0``.

    The single post-preemption *catch-up* step is indistinguishable from a decode
    step by these counts and returns True; that is safe because the query ring
    was released on preemption, so ``compact_step`` sees an incomplete window and
    skips until it refills with genuine decode queries.

    Arguments are per-request numpy int arrays (or scalars); returns a bool
    array (or numpy bool scalar).

        pass (all layers have contributed to ``score_acc`` and registered their
        caches in :meth:`observe_layer`). For each armed request it selects the
        ``budget - window_size`` highest-scoring past tokens (summed across all
        layers) plus the trailing ``window_size`` observation tokens, sorts them
        to preserve temporal order, then physically relocates that ONE kept set
        to the leading ``budget`` slots in **every** layer's paged KV and
        records the per-request evicted count.

        Compaction is **transactional**: once a request is at/over the
        threshold it MUST be handled this step, because a request that has
        already dropped KV cannot fall back to Full-KV (its old KV is gone and
        the block manager has capped its allocation). Missing state, incomplete
        layer registration, or a missing observation window therefore **raise**
        rather than silently skip. The only permitted skip is a request's
        *first* compaction whose scoring would exceed the memory cap: it is left
        Full-KV (``num_dropped`` stays 0, so the block manager never caps it).
        The evicted counts are published only after every relocation kernel is
        enqueued (``expected_layer_count`` / ``prev_dropped`` are supplied by
        the model runner; they default to permissive values for direct tests).
